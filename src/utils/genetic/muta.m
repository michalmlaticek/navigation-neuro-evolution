% muta - aditive mutation
%
%	Description:
%	The function mutates the population of strings with the intensity
%	proportional to the parameter rate from interval <0;1>. Only a few genes  
%	from a few strings are mutated in the population. The mutations are realized
%	by addition or substraction of random real-numbers to the mutated genes. The 
%	absolute values of the added constants are limited by the vector Amp. 
%	Next the mutated strings are limited using boundaries defined in 
%	a two-row matrix Space. The first row of the matrix represents the lower 
%	boundaries and the second row represents the upper boundaries of corresponding 
%	genes.
%
%
%	Syntax: 
%
%	Newpop=muta(Oldpop,rate,Amp,Space)
%
%	       Newpop - new, mutated population
%	       Oldpop - old population
%	       Amp   -  vector of absolute values of real-number boundaries
%	       Space  - matrix of gene boundaries in the form: 
%	                [real-number vector of lower limits of genes
%                        real-number vector of upper limits of genes];
%	       rate   - mutation intensity, 0 =< rate =< 1
